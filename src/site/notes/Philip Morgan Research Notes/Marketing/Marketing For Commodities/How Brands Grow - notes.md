These are actually notes on [How Brands Grow: Part 2: Emerging Markets, Services, Durables, New and Luxury Brands](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-Emerging-Services/dp/0195596269) but based on what I'm seeing from the first chapter of this book, it rehashes and expands on the first one, so from a notetaking perspective it's a good one to take notes on as I read.

- **Chapter 1**
	- Core question: does growth come from penetration or loyalty?
		- The common assumption: increasing loyalty creates a higher-profit form of growth (via targeting marketing spend on a smaller market — existing customers — that needs less "convincing" to buy more or churn/defect at a lower rate and who should be a source of effective word of mouth (WoM)) and this higher-profit form of growth can outperform pure acquisition of new customers.
		- This assumption is wrong.
	- The research supports what is known as the law of double jeopardy:
		- Loyalty is positively correlated with market share. Brands with bigger market share have more loyal customers, and the inverse is true.
		- What very rarely happens: small market share brands with highly loyal customers. This would be a niche brand. A niche brand has limited growth potential (perhaps caused by distribution restrictions, for example); a *small* brand is one that hasn't grown yet.
		- 100% brand loyalty is extremely rare, even with brands with very high penetration.
		- Loyalty does not cause growth in sales or pentration. Growth in pentration does increase loyalty.
		- A memorable way to put this: small brands do not trade away larger size to get more loyalty. This contradicts an easy-to-imagine-but-utlimately-wrong trope of the fiercely loyal-to-a-small-or-niche-brand customer. It contradicts the similarly easy-to-imagine trope of the blase buyer of the market penetration leader brand. All that small brands get for their size is fewer sales due to lower penetration and a less loyal customer base. They don't somehow win fiercely loyal customers by virtue of their small size. Maybe these people do exist, but they exist at a small enough percentage that they don't skew the overall performance of a small brand's customer base in a meaningfully positive direction.
			- Maybe we personally know (or are) someone who has high enthusiasm about small, niche brands. That's fine, but these people's niche brand enthusiasm (or perceived enthusiasm) doesn't show up in the overall numbers, and there aren't enough other enthusiasts like this to cause small/niche brands to deviate from the law of double jeopardy (small penetration -> small loyalty).
			- Similarly: it's possible that high enthusiasm for a brand coexists quite well with low purchase loyalty. "I LOOOOOOVE brand X. I also buy Brands Y and Z quite a bit as well."
			- In summary: fiercely loyal customers aren't what moves a brand from small to large market share. Here's what does:
