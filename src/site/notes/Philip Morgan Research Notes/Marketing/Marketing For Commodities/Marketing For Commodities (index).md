As with all marketing, there are theories, 1-off successes, and outright bullshit, and then there is stuff that can be proven to work via some kind of evidence/research.

The best resource I've found for an evidence-based approach to marketing *commodities* is two books:

- [How Brands Grow: What Marketers Don't Know](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-What-Marketers/dp/0195573560)
- [How Brands Grow: Part 2: Emerging Markets, Services, Durables, New and Luxury Brands](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-Emerging-Services/dp/0195596269)

These books are especially meaningful to me because they flat-out contradict a long-held belief of mine, and I cherish work that can refine my own thinking that way.

Interestingly, [Kevin Hillstrom](https://twitter.com/minethatdata?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) seems to have independently arrived at many of the same conclusions as the How Brands Grow researchers. Kevin's book, [Hillstrom's Total Package: A Marketing Management System Designed to Identify Problems and Grow Sales](https://smile.amazon.com/Hillstroms-Total-Package-Marketing-Management/dp/1728707390?sa-no-redirect=1), is a good read here, along with this piece of IP from him: [PowerPoint Presentation (minethatdata.com)](http://minethatdata.com/Kevin_Hillstrom_MineThatData_IntroductionToCustomerDevelopment.pdf)
