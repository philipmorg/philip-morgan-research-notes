# 1 - To avoid getting discouraged or quitting prematurely, you need to have appropriate expectations about lead generation

Journalists often write using what's known as the "inverted pyramid" structure. The first paragraph of the story contains the most important facts -- the "base of the pyramid". The story doesn't get any more fundamentally accurate if you read the rest of it, it just gets more detailed. That's exactly what I'm trying to do with this book.

That's why the first chapter will take you about 30 minutes to read. That's an unusually long first chapter for a business book, but it also gives me the best shot at correcting common misconceptions and giving you all of the essential, foundational ideas that you need to understand lead generation before some of you lose interest or get pulled away by other priorities in your life. :) Let's begin.

## Three Things Matter More Than Anything With Lead Generation

We're all familiar with the Pareto Principle, aka the 80/20 Rule: certain inputs have outsized influence on outputs/results. 80% of revenue comes from 20% of customers, for example. This rule doesn't always hold but, often enough, it does. 

Here's the 80/20 of lead generation for consultants and freelancers:

1. Choosing lead generation approach(es) that match your _context_
2. Articulating a *solid reason* for prospects to pay attention to you
3. Investing in *consistent execution* of the lead generation activities you chose

A generalist freelancer who is trying to recover from a bad year and a specialized consultant who is trying to build on the success of a popular book represent two _very different_ contexts. There are over 40 good lead generation approaches they could use. Why would these two people who are in very different situations use the same ones?

These two people have:

- Different constraints
- Different forms of relative advantage
- Different life circumstances, talents, skills, amounts of un-committed time in their schedule, and levels of emotional energy

Again, why would these two people who are in very different situations use the same approach to lead generation? If they're aware of how their _context_ effects their approach to lead generation, _they wouldn't use the same lead generation techniques and strategy_. They would customize their approach based on the constraints and advantages of their context. I'll show you how to do this in chapter 2.

Marketers love using words like "value proposition"; nobody really understands or has a simple, universal definition for words like these. That's an opportunity for us, because any time we encounter marketer-speak, it's an invitation to do what marketers are often unwilling or unable to do, which is to say: how does a *client* see this same idea? How would *they* describe it?

If we translate "value proposition" into client language, we end up with "a good reason to pay attention to X". The marketer says "blah blah blah our value proposition" while the potential client says "it's worth paying attention to this business because X".

Being successful with lead generation requires that you clarify and articulate a solid reason for prospects to pay attention to you/your business. You will rarely bluntly say, "You, dear prospect, should pay attention to me because X". But your clarity about why prospects should pay attention to you will infuse every aspect of whatever lead generation system you build. Without this clarity, your efforts will be diluted or ineffective.

Finally, this book will help you in many ways, but it can't do the actual work for you. The work of lead generation can range from paying thousands of dollars every month to someone who runs ads for you, to investing what ultimately amounts to thousands of unbillable hours into sharing your expertise with your market, to lots of intermediate options. All of that is *real work* involving varying levels of risk, money, time, and emotional labor. It feels excessive to say it, but I'll say it anyway: this book can't do that work for you. Only you can. This book will act as a force multiplier, though, for your effort.

## Lead Generation Does Not Create New Demand

Lead generation is a system or practice that helps you connect with existing demand. It does not create new demand. Creating new demand is the domain of innovation, thought leadership, and advertising.

People who are not being coerced in some way buy what they value more than the money it costs them to buy it. Please spend just another moment with that idea:

- People who are *not* being coerced or forced to do something they don't want to...
- Buy things that they place *more value on* than...
- *The money it costs them* to buy it.

Yes, the real world is a bit more complicated than this, but there's a profound truth here too: people buy what they value. (Buying decisions in companies are made by people or groups of people, so this applies to business as well. Companies can buy things, but it's *people* who allocate the funds.)

Most business people need to *understand something* before they can assign value to it, though in rare cases an overpowering trend (ex: "digital transformation") can push people into buying something they don't adequately understand.

**Lead generation does not help people understand new, complex stuff**. And it does not cause people to value stuff they previously didn't value. When it comes to people assigning value to stuff they didn't previously value:

- **Innovation** creates *new forms of value*.
- **Thought leadership** *introduces innovation to the market*, or makes what was old new again.
- And **advertising**, used artfully and patiently, can _help someone discover something they didn't know they wanted, educate them, or increase their valuation of something_.

You may have come across the term "demand generation" in your travels across the Internet. The best definitions I've found for demand generation basically say this: demand generation is a new sexy word for using marketing to increase interest in new products, thus the need to "generate (new) demand". 

Please don't be seduced into thinking that you can generate demand for something the market doesn't value. You might be able to encourage a few hundred or thousand people to sign up for a free trial of a new software product and when you've accomplished that, you could legitimately say that you've "generated demand" for this new product. But getting even a half-dozen companies to pay $10,000 or more for services that they do not already understand and assign value to is basically impossible. That's why I want you to avoid thinking that you can "generate demand" for something that your market does not understand. If you assume that *understanding* is a prerequisite to *assigning value* to something, and that assigning value is a prerequisite to _buying_ that thing, then you'll avoid disappointing lead generation failures.

## Starvation Is Fasting Combined With Fear

For about 7 years I lived in Portland, Oregon. My wife at the time was really into health and experimented extensively with a raw food diet. As a result, we hung out with some folks who were way into diet and fasting. I learned that, in a carefully managed fast, you can go without food for quite a while, but if you do so while feeling a lot of _fear_, your body responds like that of a starving person, which means your body starts consuming muscle tissue the way a body that is *actually* starving would. This is not good, and undermines the potential benefits of fasting. The same thing is true of lead generation.

Sometimes the best leads will come from lead generation techniques that require you to *invest* -- to spend money or time without immediate, guaranteed results. If this investment happens during a period of reduced "caloric input" for your business -- fewer leads, deals, projects, revenue, or perceived opportunity -- then you can start to feel _fear_ and that fear can cause bad results:

- Fear can cause you to pursue leads with **inappropriate aggressiveness**
- Fear can cause you to **send signals of need or extreme need** (desperation) to both clients, prospects, and colleagues
- Fear can **cloud your judgement** and make it difficult to plan and decide effectively
- Fear can cause you to **prematurely abandon initiatives** that would have worked if you had invested consistently over the medium to long term
- And fear can cause you to **"thrash" ineffectively** between short-term solutions, seeking _something_ that feels like it will work

To paraphrase a line from Frank Herbert's *Dune*, fear is the opportunity-killer. In the context of lead generation, fear is the lead-killer.

This book will help you design a lead generation system that matches your situation, so you don't take on lead generation techniques that require too much investment. That will make it less likely that you get into a "fear spiral". And this book will help you with some scenario planning so that you know when to switch away from your lead generation "Plan A" to a backup plan. This will help you feel that your decisions are more thoughtful and wise, and less reactionary. This helps you avoid "thrashing".

A client of mine started taking lead generation seriously about 3 years ago. He tried lots of the "normal" stuff (publishing insightful content, building an email list, etc.), but none of it felt right to him, even after putting in concerted effort. He redirected his lead gen efforts to finding, being present with, and creating gifts of value for small but influential communities within his target market. Towards the end of those 3 years, his own employees started directly criticizing his ability to generate new opportunity for the firm. Then, about 3 years in, within the space of 2 months, these lead generation efforts led to projects that represented 3x the previous year's revenue. My client had to decline another 1 or 2x of the revenue due to capacity limitations. It was a head-spinningly fast turnaround.

Especially in that last year, my client woke up every day and faced the question: "should I keep going with this approach that hasn't yielded any results yet? Should I keep investing in what I believe is the right way? My own employees don't have confidence in this approach!" Every day he woke up with the opportunity to pull back from the boldly generous lead generation approach he was pursuing and fall back to something less generous but more likely to produce short-term results.

My client made a decision about how to generate leads that turned out well, but for someone else in a different context, this same approach executed in the same way would have been a disastrous decision because it would have led to a fear spiral. The dwell time between the input of lead generation and output of business opportunity would have been too long for some businesses to handle and some business owners to endure.

Most likely things will go *well* for you, and you _won't_ get into a fear spiral, but I want you to understand why it's important that you avoid ending up there. The fear spiral is demoralizing, which has secondary costs elsewhere in your business, and investing time and energy in a lead generation approach that was poorly-matched to your context is an avoidable form of opportunity cost.

One more important note: fear is the opportunity killer, but that doesn't mean that you need to project complete confidence either in your interaction with prospects. Of course, some confidence (combined with a bit of wisdom and humility) helps! But the point here is to be alert to that which will suck you into a fear spiral, not to make you think that you need to have superhuman confidence. Most clients can smell false confidence anyway, and they would prefer a realistic, honest approach backed by expertise and competent delivery, calibrated to their level of risk tolerance.

## The Availability Heuristic Leads Us Astray When It Comes To Lead Generation For Complex, Expensive Services

"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Many of us have been taught this Golden Rule as youngsters. It's good advice!  But when it comes to lead generation, we wrongly assume that we should "do as others have done to us". So if we've become a lead for Service X by attending a webinar, and that happens enough times, we might (wrongly) assume that webinars are a great lead generation approach for us to use for our services. Let's explore why this inverse of the Golden Rule could lead us astray with lead generation.

Almost all of us have become a lead for someone else's business at some point. Most of us have been a lead dozens or hundreds of times over, in fact. We have done one or more of the following:

1. Filled out a form on a website in order to download something.
2. Signed up for a store loyalty card
3. Signed up for more information on something from a website
4. Called a toll-free phone number in response to an advertisement and given some information to the operator we spoke to
5. Bought something and then, without our explicit consent or knowledge, joined a list that got sold to dozens of other companies that consider us a lead

This list only scratches the surface of ways in which we can become a lead to someone else's business.

Most of us have a _ton_ of experience with #1 on that list above. In our world, it's extremely common to fill out a form on a website to get access to what's often called a "lead magnet", and then we receive an automated followup email sequence. The automated email sequence is trying to sell us something -- a book, a course, or a digital product of some kind. With this highly automated, scalable way of selling stuff, we never talk to a human, because human salespeople are expensive. Instead, we see lengthy sales pages or email sequences that try to explain the value of what's being sold, counter objections, and drum up urgency and desire to buy.

It's possible that, after enough exposure to this way of selling stuff, we start to assume that _this is just how you sell things on the Internet_. We might go further with that assumption and start to believe that _people who have become a lead by filling out a form so they can download something_ are _valuable leads_. In other words, the availability heuristic fools us into thinking that leads generated with this highly automated, scalable approach are valuable leads.

For expensive, custom services, they probably are not valuable leads. They _might be_, but they usually are not.

[@TODO: value tidbit: List of reediculously expensive/profitable/desirable projects sold without "digital marketing" funnel stuff.]

Anytime we look at something that works, we need to remember to also examine the context, because something (the breathing system of a fish, for example) that works in Context A may not work well or at all in Context B (taking the fish out of water).

Automated, scalable lead generation often works well for relatively low-priced commodities[^1] Below is a depiction of a so-called marketing funnel, which visualizes the idea that not every lead ends up buying, so you need more leads than customers/clients.

Let's imagine that the two businesses depicted both generate $300,000 USD in revenue:

- The product business sells a $300 digital course, and needs to sell 1,000 copies of the course per year.
- The services business sells custom projects that average $50,000 in revenue, so this business needs to sell 6 projects per year.

These are two extremely different lead generation challenges. If 2% of the people who become a lead for a $300 course end up buying that course, then our product business needs to generate FIFTY THOUSAND leads per year. A reasonably competitive services business can close 30 to 40 percent of its project leads, meaning that our services business needs 15 to 20 leads per year. Aside from the difference in _quantity_, the product and services business leads need to be of a different _quality_. For many course buyers, $300 is an ultimately insignificant expense, essentially an impulse buy. There are not nearly as many businesses that would treat a complex, lengthy, $50,000 project as an impulse buy! So our services business needs to generate far fewer leads, but those leads need to have the budget, intent, and seriousness needed to consider a 5 or 6-figure investment.

Could some of those 5 or 6-figure projects come from leads that filled out a form to download a lead magnet? Sure, lots of things _can_ work. The world is a big, beautiful, complex place where lots of things *can* lead to, or be associated with, a desired outcome. But if 15 to 20 people filled out a form on our services business website, could we *count on* 6 of them buying $50k worth of services? I'm a pretty risk-seeking guy, and I wouldn't take that bet in a million years. Hell no.[^2] 

I'm going to give you some solid advice in this book, but you need to realize one thing about _any_ business advice you come across: life and business are probabilistic endeavors. Aside from death and taxes, certainty is impossible, and so we're always trying to make decisions and investments that are _likely_ or _highly likely_ to produce the outcome we want.

As business owners, most of us are also heavy consumers of information products ranging from $9 e-books to $900 courses and beyond. And as members of modern society, we're also becoming a lead for some other company's products/commodities all the freaking time. This is a problem because of the availability heuristic. Wikipedia's definition is useful:

> The **availability heuristic**, also known as **availability bias**, is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled.

We can more easily remember lead generation approaches that work well for product/commodity businesses. We've had much less exposure to lead generation for expensive, complex services because so many fewer of us have _purchased_ expensive, complex services! This means that when many of us think about doing lead generation for our own business, the availability heuristic causes us to think about lead generation techniques that are less likely to generate high quality leads for us.

Don't let the availability heuristic lead you astray! (Bad pun intended. :) )

## Premature Optimization, Or How to Tell A Market You Think You're Too Good For Them

When Calendly.com came on the scene, it was a miraculous upgrade for so many of us. We could schedule meetings without all that annoying back-and-forth and time zone calculation stress and errors. Finally! A way to avoid the messy, inefficient, human part of scheduling!

I have a colleague who runs a successful business coaching business; he explicitly _avoids_ using Calendly (or other scheduling automation tools) for all the reasons I find it such a miraculous upgrade. He finds that the "inefficient" back and forth of scheduling a meeting with prospects is _also_ an opportunity: an opportunity to learn more about their situation and context. An opportunity to ask if they've gotten results from his previous advice. An opportunity to learn more about the pain that is driving the prospect to be curious about his services.

In other words, the "inefficient" back and forth of scheduling a meeting with prospects is an opportunity to _earn more trust from a prospect before quoting a price_. Yes, the manual scheduling is technically inefficient. It could be done with less effort. But the _second order effects_ of this inefficiency are so valuable that they far outweigh the inefficiency. And furthermore, switching to a more efficient scheduling approach would deprive my colleague of valuable trust-earning opportunities, and the loss of those opportunities would be damaging to his business.

When it comes to lead generation, you must be very careful about any tool or technique that promises to increase your scale or efficiency. Used artfully, such tools can add value. But remember, "you don't get a second chance to make a first impression." Think carefully about the second-order effects of any inefficiency that you find in your lead generation system. Those inefficiencies might be a pure loss and need to be optimized. But they might be an inseparable part of something more valuable.

There still exist bank and governmental buildings with magnificent, extremely "wasteful" architecture. From a pure efficiency perspective, you don't need a marble-floor lobby with 30-foot ceilings and tons of un-used space. But what if the purpose of that lobby is not to efficiently house people and umbrellas? What if its real purpose is to send a signal about trust or power or status? Then the lobby's "inefficiency" isn't a waste at all!

In your lead generation system, if you're thinking about replacing a 30-minute phone call with a lengthy web form with lots of qualifying questions and conditional branching, make sure you aren't chasing the wrong kind of cost reduction. If you're thinking about replacing public speaking with a pre-recorded webinar, ask yourself whether that's the right kind of "lobby" for your business. None of these things -- phone calls, web forms, public speaking, or webinars -- are "right" or "wrong". They are options that work well or not-so-well within a given _context_. Context is king here.

## Some Lead Generation Techniques Require You To Be A Performer

Some lead generation techniques require you to perform. Not become a full-time, talented performer, but they require you _to perform_, meaning one or more of the following:

- To entertain
- To hold the interest of a person or group of people who have lots of other things competing for their interest
- To surprise and delight

Basically, anything you do beyond making your lead generation _useful_ tends to be some form of _performance_. I don't use the word perform/performance dismissively. Our culture highly values those who can perform, and those who can combine performance with usefulness or education have uniquely powerful options when it comes to lead generation.

But! Performance tends to require skill and reserves of emotional energy that not all of us have, and not all of us have enough of this emotional energy at all times. Furthermore, the ole' availability heuristic makes this problematic. Lead generation techniques combined with a well-done performance are more _memorable_, and as a result, if we think "hey, I need to get serious about generating leads" and then think "how have *others* generated leads?", we will remember stuff that is... more memorable. And that includes lead generation techniques like the ones below:

- Public speaking as lead generation
- Podcast guesting
- Webinars
- Being very interesting/funny/insightful on social media

If we are wired in a way that makes performance difficult for us, or if we are currently short on emotional energy, then the more performative lead generation techniques are not a good fit for us. This is not to discourage you from stretching and growing as a person in order to get better at using performative lead generation techniques! These techniques are uniquely powerful options precisely because of their performative nature. There's something about a person "getting naked" -- to borrow a metaphor from Patrick Lencioni -- that builds trust extremely rapidly.

But there's also a lot to be said for choosing lead generation techniques that fit your context and constraints, and if you're just not currently well-supplied with emotional energy or the time and energy needed to learn how to be a better performer, then you should avoid lead generation techniques that require performance. How you generate leads _now_ does not restrict you from adding more or better or merely different lead generation techniques _later_, so please feel completely free to choose the lead generation techniques that fit your _current context_, and then change those choices as your context morphs over time (which it will!). 

## There Are 3 Basic Lead Generation Scenarios

In this book, I'm going to help you choose lead generation approaches that are a great fit for _your_ specific context, and I'm going to help you implement those choices. When we look at your context, we'll consider several factors:

- Why are you investing in lead generation? In other words, what's your _aspiration_? Is it to level up, regain lost opportunity, or de-risk your current lead generation?
- What kind of services do you offer? Do they address *crises*, do they help clients *optimize* something, or do they address some kind of *ongoing need* that clients regularly have?
- What *time*, *money*, and *emotional energy* do you have available to invest in lead generation?
- What *specialized focus* does your business have?

While all of these factors matter, the one that has the biggest effect on how you approach lead generation is your _aspiration_. Someone whose aspiration is to level-up their business (moving from implementation to advisory work, for example) is going to use an almost entirely different set of lead generation techniques than someone who is seeking to regain lost opportunity.

After I've helped you assess your situation (chapter 2), I'll present three shortlists of lead generation techniques, one for each overall situation. Then you'll use the other aspects of your situation to further narrow down your shortlist. Then you'll have a not-overwhelming list of lead generation techniques that are a great fit for your situation.

## There Are Baseline Lead Generation Activities Everyone Should Do

No matter what your specific situation, there are lead generation techniques you should use. You should use them because _everybody_ should use them.

Some of these are "common sense" that it's easy to ignore or tell yourself you'll get to later. Some of these are things that are easy to overlook or forget. And a few are just doing things differently than you're used to. Chapter 4 details all of these baseline lead generation activities.

Lead generation approaches roughly fit into two categories: active and passive. Active lead generation requires your ongoing active participation. Outbound cold email is a good example. There's no such thing as 100% passive lead generation, but some lead generation techniques, like leads generated by blog articles, work without our ongoing active involvement after the initial setup effort is done.

When people get desperate for new business, they almost always turn to active lead generation techniques. This is not irrational; these techniques have the highest probability of getting results quickly! However, even smart, ethical people can make bad decisions when desperation overcomes their better judgement. And so active lead generation techniques combined with desperate people creates a lot of outreach that is basically spam: irrelevant, pushy, and sloppily done.

Combine all of _that_ with the availability heuristic, and what do we get? 

1. I say something like "cold email" and...
2. Most of us have a negative reaction because...
3. The cold emails that are the *easiest for us to remember* are the *terrible* cold emails sent by desperate people/companies.

This makes it easy for us to assume that _active_ lead generation equates with _desperate lead generation_.

Please don't make this assumption. Active lead generation techniques can be used with ethical care and high precision, and can generate strong ROI. These techniques only signal desperation if their _content_ signals desperation, and that content is fully within your control. The templates and processes I provide in this book will give you a starting point that is 180 degrees opposite from desperation or neediness.

## You're Now Smarter About Lead Generation Than Most Of Your Peers

The state of the art with lead generation is basically like being a teenager hoping to get laid for the first time. The advice you get from some of your peers is what worked for them. The advice you get from your friends who *haven't* gotten laid is based on aesthetically appealing theories they've picked up from movies or who knows elsewhere. Vendors in the space are using your hormonal drives to sell you shit that won't actually help with your goal. The "adults" in your life (more advanced business owners) know you'll eventually figure out your own unique approach and so recommend starting with the basics, which is fine, but can leave you feeling like you're on your own with this challenge.

My hope is that 30 minutes into this book, you've evolved multiple decades past that "teenager" mindset with respect to lead generation. At this point, I hope you have started to absorb the key concepts that help you defend against those vendors and their products that won't really help. I hope you've also:

- Started to think about how your **context drives your lead generation approach**.
- Understood **where lead generation can work and where thought leadership is needed**.
- Become aware of how **fear can cause your lead generation to come across as desperate**.
- Possibly **taken action on the "get leads NOW" recipe**.
- Seen how our **frequent exposure to lead generation that works for commodity services can lead us astray** when generating leads for our complex, custom services.
- Understood the **danger of premature optimization**.
- Learned how **being a performer is powerful, but keeps some of us** from using certain lead gen techniques.

In the next chapter, you will translate _your context_ into a shortlist of suitable lead generation approaches. Onward!


[^1]: A commodity is anything that can be delivered at high levels of consistency and quality, sold at a price the market considers reasonable, and made with a scalable business model and production process. We tend to think of commodities as un-differentiated, cheap products, but in reality commodities can include anything from executive coaching to websites to houses to pork bellies.

[^2]: I'm making my point by portraying a business that is using a _single_ lead generation activity. That's unrealistically simplified; most businesses will use a combination of several lead generation techniques, and even a services business that needs to sell six $50k projects might use lead generation techniques that mostly generate low-quality leads but sometimes generate high-quality leads. They would do this because life and business are probabilistic, and you almost never know what will work, so you build a _portfolio_ of lead generation techniques, observe what works, and refine that portfolio over time. In making this point, I'm also ignoring the fact that plenty of people will pay $300 for a course 10 minutes after they discover it, meaning they never really become a lead, they just move from complete stranger to customer quit quickly. This would mean our product business needs somewhat less than 50,000 new leads per year.
