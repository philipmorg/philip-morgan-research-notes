# How do those who have spent more than $20,000 on a consulting project that did not involve an RFP find the consultant they hired?

## Background

I think those of us in the marketing advice game deal with some challenging biases:

- If we advise on the basis of *our own local experience* (ex: "this worked for me", or "these firms I know about and admire are doing X and Y") then we may miss better options that are outside our local awareness.
- If we advise based on *aesthetics* (ex: "content marketing feels like the most honest way to generate opportunity because....") then we may give poorly-matched or bad advice.
- If we look at firm *financial performance and model what the winners in that race* do, we may model correctly for a certain context but incorrectly for a different context, or we may miss factors that are ultimately more influential than how those firms approach marketing.
	- If we use the *same sampling method and gather memory-based data* from the winners, we may get Halo Effect-skewed data, though this is a minor risk given that many marketing activities have track-able results and somewhat more objectively-measurable inputs.

I believe that researching the buying side of a consulting transaction may provide more useful data and insight. This is somewhat in the spirit of *[[Philip Morgan Research Notes/Active Research/Marketing/Marketing For Non-Commodities/How Clients Buy - A Practical Guide to Business Development for Consulting and Professional Services|How Clients Buy - A Practical Guide to Business Development for Consulting and Professional Services]]*

## Intent

Use a grounded theory method. Interview 30 people who made the decision to buy >$20k of consulting services without using an RFP process. Recruit these interviewees using a medium-length survey that will gather qualitative data, incidentally producing well over 30 data points of a less rich and nuanced quality in the process.

(A core assumption here is that "no RFP-involved" is a good proxy for "not-yet-commoditized or completely un-commoditized solution space".)

Potential questions:

- Have you ever hired an independent consultant for a project larger than $20K without using a Request For Proposal (RFP)?
- Think of that project as you answer the following questions:
	- How much was this project worth to your business? (How much value or cost savings or other benefit did it create?)
	- How much did you pay the consultant you hired?
	- How did the consultant you hired price the project in question?
	- How did you first become aware of the consultant you hired?
	- Approximately how many other consultants or other solutions did you consider for the project in question?
		- If you considered multiple consultants for this project, how did you first become aware of the alternative consultants?
	- Why did you choose the consultant you did for this project?
- Anything else you'd like to add about this?
- Your name & email address
