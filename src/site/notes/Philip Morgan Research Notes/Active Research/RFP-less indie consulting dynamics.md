Thinking through the recruitment:

## LinkedIn in-connection message survey

Potential questions:

- Have you ever hired an independent consultant for a project larger than $20K without using a Request For Proposal (RFP)?
- Think of that project as you answer the following questions:
	- How much was this project worth to your business? (How much value or cost savings or other benefit did it create?)
	- How much did you pay the consultant you hired?
	- How did the consultant you hired price the project in question?
	- How did you first become aware of the consultant you hired?
	- Approximately how many other consultants or other solutions did you consider for the project in question?
	- Why did you choose the consultant you did for this project?
- Your name & email address

A3: No

A core assumption here is that "no RFP-involved" is a good proxy for "not-yet-commoditized or completely un-commoditized solution space"
