## LinkedIn in-connection message survey

Potential questions:

- Have you ever hired an independent consultant for a project larger than $20K without using a Request For Proposal (RFP)?
- Think of that project as you answer the following questions:
	- How much was this project worth to your business? (How much value or cost savings or other benefit did it create?)
	- How much did you pay the consultant you hired?
	- How did the consultant you hired price the project in question?
	- How did you first become aware of the consultant you hired?
	- Approximately how many other consultants or other solutions did you consider for the project in question?
		- If you considered multiple consultants for this project, how did you first become aware of the alternative consultants?
	- Why did you choose the consultant you did for this project?
- Anything else you'd like to add about this?
- Your name & email address

Feedback:

A:

-   Would it be better to split the first question in two?
	-   1) Have you ever hired an independent consultant for a project larger than $20K
	-   2) How did you hire the consultant? (Maybe multiple choice with RFP as one option and then an “other/fill in the blank”, too? … And is there a chance that you might capture some unexpected input that reveals how respondents think about the ways they hire or what the catalyst is?)
-   Then, if the answer to 1 is yes and the answer to 2 doesn’t include RFP, they proceed to following questions … It’s true that you’d be introducing more questions, and as you know the general rule is less is more, but I wonder if a more … _atomic_ approach would reduce cognitive load. (Atomic as in small parts, not bombs)
-   Re: “how did the consultant price the project” — Maybe another opportunity for multi-choice with an “other” option?

B:

Does the survey include independent consultants hired via a staffing agency? If not, you might want to make that clear. 

There might be regional variations. Is it worth asking which country the respondent lives/works?

Additional questions that spring to mind….

Had you used this consultant previously for smaller projects?

Did the consultant offer different options which you then chose the option that best fitted your needs?

Would you use that consultant again and/or recommend them to a friend/colleague?
