More coming soon to this note, but in the meantime, here are two books that, though they never use the word _thought leadership_, have a lot to say about how thought leadership happens:

- [The Anatomy of Humbug: How to Think Differently About Advertising](https://amazon.com/dp/B00SHB05M2)
- [Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos](https://amazon.com/dp/B07WVV5J2R)

Both of these books describe how ambitious, curious people led the thinking of an audience. If you abstract away some of the details, you'll see the shape of a journey that is applicable to almost any campaign of thought leadership, large or small, mercenary or missionary in nature.
