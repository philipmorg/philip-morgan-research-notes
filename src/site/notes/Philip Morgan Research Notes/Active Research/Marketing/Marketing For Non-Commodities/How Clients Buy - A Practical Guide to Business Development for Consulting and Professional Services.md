- **Title**: How Clients Buy- A Practical Guide to Business Development for Consulting and Professional Services
- **Author**: Tom McMakin and Doug Fletcher
- **Amazon link**: [https://amazon.com/dp/B079V5X876](https://amazon.com/dp/B079V5X876)

**Summary**: The best summary of this book might be the authors own words: "We believe that in consulting and professional services, you do not win new business by focusing on sales funnel–type activities but rather by starting from a place of empathy with your would-be clients. This empathy requires us to view the buying journey from the perspective of what prospective clients need before they can engage and only then to ask, “How can I support a potential client as they seek to satisfy these seven basic needs?” The seven elements of the client's journey are (again, the authors' own words):

- I am aware of you and/or your company.
- I understand what you do and how you and your firm are unique.
- I have an interest in what you do because it is relevant and potentially of value to me.
- I respect your professional expertise and believe that you can help me.
- I trust that you are honest. I believe you have my best interest at heart, and I feel comfortable working with you.
- I have the funds and organizational support and have the ability to buy from you.
- This is a priority for me, and I am ready to engage.

These 7 elements are a way to decompose a bizdev approach/system into components that you can individually troubleshoot and optimize, which makes it easier to get better results.

**Philip's Reaction**

Like a lot of similar biz books it's too long, too repetitive, too trying-to-be folksy, it uses dumb stories in most chapters, and it described a culture that feels like DEATH to me (blah blah blah *over drinks*; blah blah blah *over turkey wraps in the cafeteria*; blah blah blah *best blue blazer*; blah blah blah *join the X country club some day*). And yet, it was a valuable read and gets points for:

- Identifying that there are different types of consulting services: acute/crisis, optimizing, evergreen (which I would call commoditized, like ongoing tax prep support)
- Breaking down the components of ready-to-buy into 7 discrete elements, each of which can be considered somewhat individually and, as a result, improved in a more focused way
- Identifying the patterns they see in "type of consulting service" and "which of the 7 buying journey components they usually have to work harder on"
- Putting direct response marketing in a proper context vs. network-building. They don't really talk about brand marketing at all aside from a few references to "it's not a problem if you dear reader can't afford airport display advertising" and the  like. But they do a reasonable job of showing why DR marketing often falls short of the trust-building needed for selling big consulting projects (let's think of them as 7-figure plus projects).

Overall, it left me with a slightly sick feeling, though, because so much of the world the book illustrated (through its actual examples and example-ish hypotheticals) was a social world I do not want to live in: airports, suits, turkey wraps, bonding over alcohol, and IRL interactions I don't have the emotional energy for. The authors did try to gesture at the ways you could still implement the book's ideas in a different way (for example using writing as a way to earn visibility and trust rather than calling people), but in the end it felt like they were saying "here's the scratch-and-dent version of the idea we're selling...".

But this sick feeling was just part of the picture. Overall, I think they're right about the need for relationship/network/fungal/brand-ish marketing; I just find myself wanting to modulate the parts they're right about through my own preferences: what does applying the truth of what they've identified to a no-travel, almost no-unscheduled-phone calls introverted world look like? That's really the only modifications I insist on. I'm fine wearing a nicer-than-usual shirt when the video camera is on. I'm fine doing quite a few scheduled calls. I'm fine speaking a lot on a podcast or recorded video. And I think there are lots of other folks out there with the same desired modifications. :) 

This book's thesis is very similar to Rich Litvin's thesis about selling coaching. Rich's is less nuanced, but appropriately so for the less complex context of coaching vs. 7-figure consulting projects and the attendant complex sales process.

The gap left by this book and Rich Litvin's book is around this context: you sell 5 to 6-figure projects [^1], you work on your own or with some part-time assistance, you're a bit of an outsider, you think of air travel for work purposes as a rare exception and not the norm, and you've never asked yourself "how can I find ways to spend more time with people I don't feel comfortable around?" The usual answer to this context seems to be "direct response all the things; get more clients with a digital marketing funnel." I think that's part of the answer, but certainly not a complete one.

I'm automatically interested in any book on sales/marketing that incorporates research into how clients *actually* behave, choose, think, and prefer. This book claims to, but doesn't surface much of the actual research data in the book's body. I don't think that weakens the book very much; it deprived me of some geeky shop talk I wish the book had offered, but given the books' audience and goals, I understand the decision not to go deep into the research methodology and findings.

**Overall**:

This book joins the [[Philip Morgan Research Notes/Active Research/Marketing/Marketing For Non-Commodities/Useful Books On Marketing And Selling Non-Commodities|canon]]. Welcome! There are too few of this kind of book, and despite particular the ways it doesn't precisely fit my audience's context, it has a lot to offer and it touches on some important, fundamental truths.
