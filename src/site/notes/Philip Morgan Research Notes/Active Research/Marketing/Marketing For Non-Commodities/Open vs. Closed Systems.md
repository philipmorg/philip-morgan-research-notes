	- "Structurally closed systems (like a closed pan of soup or hot water in a thermos) exist only conceptually or analytically; however, _operationally_ closed systems exist in realityâ€”or more precisely, they are observable.""
	- "Social systems (and other autopoietic systems) are [structurally open](https://socialsystemstheory.com/2016/09/09/more-thoughts-on-structural-coupling/) and [operationally closed](https://socialsystemstheory.com/2019/09/11/on-discipline-and-grids/). To be structurally open means expectations ([social structures are expectations](https://socialsystemstheory.com/2017/08/23/social-structures-are-expectations/)) may be perturbed by the environment. Operational closure means that a social system only communicates with itself; there is no communication between system and environment."

So, just to write this in my own words:

- There are no fully closed systems. That's just a theoretical construct. There is, however, a useful distinction between *structurally closed* and *operationally closed* systems.
- There are no fully structurally closed systems in reality.
- There are opertionally closed systems in reality. Operational closure means the system does not communicate with its environment.

At this point, I can see the following contributing to openness of a system:

- Complexity of the system itself
- Connectedness between the system and its environment, or other systems in its environment
	- More connectedness would expose the system to more change (irritations/perturbances)
- Amount of central control
	- Might be mapped by mapping communication pathways as a graph?
