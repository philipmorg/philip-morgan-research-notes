I have this notion that some services are more transformational in nature, and some are more optimization or problem-solving focused. I'm talking about a spectrum, of course, not two binary polarities.

This has been a troublesome notion, because it suggests that we might use different approaches for marketing, and if this is true, we now have a problem: there isn't just one good way to market indie expert services. The best way of marketing might be a consequence of where you land on this transformation - optimization spectrum. Or similarly, some ways of marketing might be incompatible with transformation or optimization.

This spectrum has a sort of "interpenetrating poles" thing going on. Maybe all spectrums do? Extrememe optimization is transformational in nature. Transformation is a result of continual optimization, etc. This makes it hard to concieve of and talk about transformation vs. optmization.

And yet, I think there's something here...

If we read something like Sean D'Souza's "Brain Audit", it's easy to walk away with the idea that the marketing for pretty much any product needs to focus on the *problem* that product solves.

Let's apply this to a shoe from Nike (I do so mostly as an outsider to serious athleticism). We ask: "what *problem* does this Nike show solve?" I'm pretty sure that question could be answered in a multitude of ways:

- more durable, so it doesn't fall apart after a few months and leave you with the problem of feeling dissapointed and ripped off. 
- better designed, so you don't sprain your ankle doing athletic stuff.
- more fashionable, so your friends think better of you.

And on and on. It's not hard to imagine a nice-sized list of problems that this Nike shoe could solve for the customer.

Why, then, does Nike not run commercials that are like this?

- Why do they seem to focus more on the aspiration of athleticism than problem-solving for athleticism?
- Why do they not seem to "educate the customer" that high quality gear helps fulfill this aspiration?

My ignorance about athleticism or my incomplete knowledge of Nike's marketing might be why I can't easily answer these questions. But I do think there's something important and relevant here.

For services that are transformational in nature, we have to ask: how do we sell them?

This question haunted me a while back. It still does, but as I've spent more time with the question it's gotten less rather than more clear to me. Anyway...

I came up with 6 models for "selling transformation":

1. **Mixed Methods**: Use gated lead magnets (a classic direct response (DR) marketing tool) to encourage folks to enter a BM world. Once they enter that world, the “laws of physics” are that of Brand Marketing. The email list experience, for example, is one big possibly-costly-to-you but impactful-to-list-members gift. What’s sold via the list or other ways of connecting with your audience is transformation. That’s it; no optimization sold here.
2. **Classic DR Funnel**: You have a pretty “normal” DR marketing funnel, and you sell a combination of optimization and transformation services. The first offer(s) to folks in the funnel is probably a low-ish friction optimization offer (the “undergraduate” level in my diagram). As you earn more trust from folks in the funnel or these folks mature in their business and their appetite for bigger challenges grows, you start to sell them transformation services (“masters” and “phd”).
3. **Transformation Brand**: You just build a brand that’s about transformation from day 1. I’ve seen this happen with a manifesto-ey, call-to-arms-ish book. The book inspires and challenges and lays out the terms of the transformation. Some are attracted to the potential transformation, and the rather broad reach of the book starts to attract folks into a brand ecosystem. You might — and probably would — combine other elements of tastefully-done DR marketing, but the book and the ideas it contains is the real active ingredient in this recipe.
4. **Bait-And-Switch Funnel**: This resembles the Classic DR Funnel, but you only sell transformation services. I call it a bait-and-switch only tongue in cheek, but also to point out that what attracts people into the funnel is the promise of a direct, relatively easy, optimization-based fix to a common problem. You _do_ provide a lightweight version of that fix at the mouth of the funnel (which might be a lead magnet, email course, or some other fix delivery mechanism). But once that is out of the way, your real focus is selling the transformation that aligns with the services you actually offer.
5. **GP Referrals**: Surgeons get their referrals from a network of general practitioners. A part of what licensed professions offer — to make the bitter pill of licensing worth it — is institutional support that makes marketing less important. I wonder what it would take to create this same dynamic in an unlicensed profession such as you and I practice? It seems possible but… somehow not easy, and for some reason — to me at least — not as interesting as any of the previous options!
6. **Recruiting**: I have a friend who sells marketing services to a certain type of professional services firms. He has really figured out what events and partner organizations he can recruit from. He’s very good at this model. In his case, it’s not a formal agreement between him and the “farm league” organization — which is sometimes a complementary service provider and sometimes a watering hole or community-based business — but rather a “nose” that he has for the kind of places that will have the kind of prospective clients that are a good match for him. He travels a fair bit because many of these events are IRL and, to be fair, he’s selling optmization more than transformation, but still it’s a relevant example of recruiting.

Thinking about this more circa 24/01/21 -- and on the back of a coaching engagement with a client who is primed to build a somewhat transformational brand -- I think model number 2 might be ideal in some ways.

In my thinking, I've re-configured how I think about this model to this:

- It's a fractal approach. Sell "fractals" of the overall transformation; small products or contained services (workshops, for example) that embody the brand's overall approach.
- The small products are very problem-focused in their design and marketing.
	- Mapping this to PMC:
		- My overall brand is about helping experts thrive. TEI is the most "brand-ey" embodiement of that brand vision. TEI sells best to folks who have been exposed to the idea for a while.
		- The fractal approach would be to build an array of small products/contained services that focus on problems that early stage experts have.
		- These products/services would (unavoidably!) contain the feel and approach and promise of the larger brand. They would, ideally, both satisfy a hunger and whet an appetite. They would both cure a small wound and fortify the customer for a longer journey.
		- These products/services inform the customer about their location and membership within a larger community of products, customers, and brand "connective tissue".


This approach seems suitable for an incremental build of the brand.

There's also the approach that Blair Enns took (#3 above), which seems more like: "build the brand you want from day one, and grow it steadily over time".
