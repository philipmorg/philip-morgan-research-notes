# How Might We Understand Marketing?

If we were going to understand marketing, we might look at 4 parts of the system:

- 1) The buy side of the system
	- We might look at stated and revealed preferences of those who buy
	- We might look at the individual and group levels
- 2) Ideas/theories
	- We might choose to believe aesthetically-appealing ideas/theories without reference to evidence
- 3) The sell side of the system
	- We might inventory everything that we can observe being done on the sell side (the "active" side of the system when it comes to marketing)
	- We might look at the "winners" (defined and sampled as best we can) and try to model what we see them doing
		- As we do this, we might remain outside observers
		- Or, we might interview "insiders"/participants about what they are doing/did
	- We might try a more scientific approach, where we have a hypothesis, a control group, and an experimental application of the hypothesis group
- 4) The practitioners within the system
	- This is sort of a subset of the sell side of the system, but broken out separately
	- We might try to learn from practitioners what they have tried and what they believe works/doesn't work; we might be seeing what "always works" (ha!) or what works within a given context (more realistic)
