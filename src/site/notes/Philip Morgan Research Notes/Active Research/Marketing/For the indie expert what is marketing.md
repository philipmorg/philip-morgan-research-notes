Marketing is earning visibility and trust for your services.

At the highest level, marketing is organized into two domains. Because many indie expert businesses are "product in the streets, consulting in the sheets" businesses, there are notes on both domains of marketing:

1. [[Philip Morgan Research Notes/Active Research/Marketing/Marketing For Commodities/Marketing For Commodities (index)|Marketing For Commodities (index)]]
2. [[Philip Morgan Research Notes/Active Research/Marketing/Marketing For Non-Commodities/Marketing For Non-Commodities (index)|Marketing For Non-Commodities (index)]]

The best high-level overview of all of marketing that I've encountered is [The Anatomy of Humbug: How to Think Differently About Advertising](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Humbug-Think-Differently-Advertising-ebook/dp/B00SHB05M2) by Paul Feldwick. Advertising is but one facet of marketing, but Paul's book is several things all in one:

1. It's a high-level, breezy, enjoyable overview of the history of the advertising agency business.
2. It's a well-balanced exploration of the primary theories of marketing that have emerged from the world of advertising.
3. It's (incidentally) a great case study of how thought leadership actually works.

## Commodities and Non-Commodities

It's common to distinguish commodities from non-commodities based on their level of fungibility. In this view, products or services are called commodities because they are highly fungible, meaning they are easily replaced by nearly-identical substitutes. We think of flour or gasoline or light bulbs when we think of this level of interchangeability.

Fungibility is often seen as a lack of _product differentiation_. However, adding or removing differentiation is not sufficient to move something into or out of the commodity category.

Commodities also requires a scalable production model. Indie consultants often embrace an un-scalable production model because we don't want to hire, train, and manage staff. We prefer working alone, but that involves accepting a hard cap on our production model. Moving from hourly billing to fixed pricing can significantly increase the dollars of profit we generate with our fixed production capacity. Many of us also explore hybrid revenue models that employ zero marginal cost digital products and one-to-many service offerings.

Advice about marketing commodities assumes that if you want more dollars of profit, you will sell more units of product. If all that an indie consultant has available to sell is their time, they are selling something that -- seen through the fungibility/differentiation lens -- might be called a commodity but seen through the scalable production model lens would _not_ actually be a commodity. Advice that assumes your primary goal is to sell more units of product is not suitable for a context where there is a fixed supply of the product.

A way to simplify and make this more memorable: is the marketing advice in question advice on how to _sell more things_ or how to _sell more valuable things_?

That's why the _first_ question you pose to any marketing advice-giver is "What context is this advice speaking to?" and your second question should be about the business model assumptions they are making when giving their advice. And I'll humbly suggest: if the advice-giver isn't clear and specific about the context and business model they're speaking to, then move on to one who is.

## Advertising vs. Marketing

Another noteworthy distinction I want to make: it's common for people to use the word _marketing_ when they actually mean _advertising_. Advertising is actually a subset of marketing, but many people use the two words as synonyms. This is a consequential error because it confuses spending money to display a message at scale (advertising) with the work of earning visibility and trust for your services (marketing). Some people or organizations do no marketing beyond advertising, and in that one special case their advertising and marketing efforts would be the same thing, but in all other cases, advertising is a subset of marketing.

This tweet thread is a good example of someone conflating advertising with marketing:

It's very reasonable for them to use these words interchangeably because they're operating in the commodities context.
