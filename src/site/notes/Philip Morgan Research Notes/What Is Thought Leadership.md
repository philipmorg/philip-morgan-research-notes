# What Is Thought Leadership?

Expertise is not enough.

Demonstrations of that expertise are not enough.

You need to make an argument -- a claim, supported with evidence -- to your market.

Most of you don't want to. I get it. It threatens to fuck with a not-so-bad status quo.

Those who do want to have a shot at become recognized thought leaders.

Those who buy into this idea but don't really care to become thought leaders get distinctive, memorable marketing as a result. That ain't so bad.
