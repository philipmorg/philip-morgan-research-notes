# ADHD Resources

I probably do not have clinical-level ADHD. But when I talk to folks with diagnosed adult ADHD, read about it, and think about the sort of "induced ADHD" that ubiquitious wireless computing can create, I begin to think that resources for dealing with ADHD are useful to all of us indie experts.

- https://www.andrewaskins.com/how-i-run-a-company-with-adhd/
	- Copy/paste of main points of this (really good) article:
		- **Fight shame**. It's an asshole of an emotion. Don't let it rule your life. You're not a bad person just because you have done bad things.
		- Find a way to **create healthy pressure**. Raise money or hire a coach. Whatever it is, invest time learning what motivates you.
		- **Prioritize obsessively**. Lists, lists, lists. Don't overcomplicate it to start, a blank sheet of paper works great.
		- **Start small**. Look for a small win to start your day off and build momentum from there.
		- **Embrace minimalism** in your digital and physical life. The fewer visual triggers to distract you the better.
		- **Find the work you love.** The internet has created a new world where any niche can turn into a sustainable profession. Worry about the finances later, focus on finding work you enjoy.
