## About these notes

I'm not quite an [indie researcher](https://andymatuschak.org/2020/), not quite a consultant, and not quite an Internet authority. I am convinced that sharing my research, even in messy unfinished form, could be useful or interesting to some. If you find something of interest and would like to discuss more, send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Philip_Morgan).
